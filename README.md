Cumulative Search from various search engines.
Now its just alpha skeleton, hopefully ill find time to add [duck](https://duckduckgo.com/) ...

## Fast Start
`git clone & pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python app.py` then `localhost:13370` and search stuff
lxml needs to be installed manually on some platforms(etc win7).

If ran on linux, Xvfb() needs to be ran first as said in comments.

Tested with legacy old-skool python2.
